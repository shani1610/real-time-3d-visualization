# Real Time 3D Visualization

This repository contains the results of practical works for the Real Time 3D Visualization class in Jean Monnet University, lectured by Professor Philippe Colantoni. 
The first aim of this course is to understand the modern GPU architectures and capabilities. The second is
to understand and apply the basic and advanced techniques of real-time 3D rendering in the context of XR.
A focus will be placed on the web technologies (WebGL, WebVR and WebXR) that will be used to
implement these techniques.
